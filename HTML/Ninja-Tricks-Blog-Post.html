<h1>Tricks for finding poorly publicized online courses.
</h1>

<h2>What are you interested in learning?</h2>

<p>Ask yourself that question upfront.

If you are not sure, just pick a category and start exploring free content, which eventually will lead you to the paid content. Instead of just blindly Googling around on your topic, here’s my ninja tricks for finding excellent blogs, podcasts and courses fast. Start by listening.
</p>
<h3>Start with the ear in mind</h3>
<p>Generally once a blogger has built an audience, he or she will expand into podcasting, then sell access to a paid course. That’s why I’ve found the most practical way to get at the established experts in a niche online is to focus first on who is podcasting on the topic, then follow their podcasts to their online blogs.
Before going to Google, search on iTunes.com and Sticher.com. Search using keywords you are interested in, such as “online marketing” or “cooking,” or “entrepreneur” and inevitably you’ll run into excellent podcasts.
Listen to a handful on your device of choice then seek out the websites of your favorites. If you want to move faster, skip the listening in favor of just looking at the highest rated podcasts.  The descriptions will typically include the website address, or you can just Google the person’s or podcast’s name. For many of them, the website is where the bulk of their free content resides.

Many times podcasts will double as blog posts and include <a href="http://www.newrainmaker.com/audio/jay-baer-interview/" target="_blank">show notes</a> on those episodes, giving you links to other websites mentioned in the articles. In addition, if a guest is on the podcast, that person’s resources will also be available for you to reference. Sometimes the guest will create a special offer just for listeners of that particular episode of the podcast the guest was on.</p>

If you happen to be particularly interested in online marketing, there’s also a nascent search engine specifically designed for finding podcasts in the marketing niche. By the time you read this they may have expanded into other niches however. I’ve used it a few times and found it pretty useful for that particular niche. <a href="https://marketingpodcasts.com/" target="_blank">Go here</a> to check it out.

<h3>Check out the black book of blog topics</h3>
If you want to begin reading blogs on your topic, then visit <a href="http://www.alltop.com" target="_blank">alltop.com</a>. It is the best website to visit when you want to find the key blogs in major and minor niches.
<h3>Visit a gateway learning site</h3>
If you want to skip a lot of the free content and focus on finding a course you can enroll in, here is what I advise:

Are you just wanting to learn because you’re fascinated by a topic? If you had the time and money, would you take college classes just for fun? Then looking at online courses from <a href="http://www.thegreatcourses.com" target="_blank">The Great Courses</a> or <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank">Coursera</a> might be perfect.

Perhaps instead you’re toying with wanting to learn your first programming language. Then you might want to look at classes geared for would-be programmers, such as offerings on <a href="https://www.bento.io/" target="_blank"> this search engine</a>, which curates programming classes from a variety of websites, and creates learning pathways you can follow based on your particular coding interest. <a href="http://www.lynda.com" target="_blank">Lynda.com</a> also is strong in offering a wide array of programming classes.

Or maybe you just want to learn how others are creating online programs? Then <a href="http://www.therisetothetop.com/" target="_blank">The Rise To The Top</a> by David Siteman Garland might have what you need. David also has a great course just on interviewing others, based on his years of running his website, which began purely as an interview show.

Do you want to become an online entrepreneur? Then programs like <a href="http://www.marieforleo.com" target="_blank">Marie Forleo</a> or <a href="http://mixergy.com/goto/welcome/" target="_blank">Mixergy</a> might be a fit.

Once you find a website that feels like it might have what you’re looking for, you can look at programs they mention or partner with to find other potential courses closely related to your area of interest.
<h3>A final nifty trick for finding the right courses for you</h3>
Because there is so much great content available, but the courses are often hidden behind websites and email signup forms, I continually add to my trove of online learning resources. This way you can bookmark a single page that shows you exactly where to go to find the course of your choosing<p>
