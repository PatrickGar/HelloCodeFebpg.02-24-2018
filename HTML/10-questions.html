            <h1>10 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Purchasing an Online Course</h1>
            <p>If you’ve ever been on the verge of purchasing an online course, you know it’s like being a nine-year-old on the night before Christmas — awesome yet agonizing.</p>
            <p>You’ve read and reread the page selling you on buying the product (often called a landing page).</p>
            <p>You know you want the product, but now the logical side of you is wondering whether you really should plunk down your plastic or PayPal account number.</p>
            <i>Trust me, I really do know how you feel.</i>
            <p>I’m a huge advocate — some would even call me an addict — of online learning, having purchased more than 15 courses over the past five years.</p>
            
            <p>Through taking all those courses, I also realize you can easily purchase the wrong online course, or too many online courses on the same general topic, or use the courses as fancy way to avoid doing the real work that moves you toward a new career direction, or launched your own online business.</p>
            
            <p>In the end, I’ve never regretted purchasing any online course, but would have made smarter decisions had I known what I know now.  To help you avoid haunting regret, I've put together the below checklist of questions to ask yourself before taking the plunge.</p>
            
            <h2>Questions to answer before you buy your next online course:</h2>
            
            <h3>1.  Beyond consuming the content, what do you really hope to achieve from this course, and by what deadline?</h3>
            
            <p>Whether your goal is simply the pleasure of learning something new, or to acquire a skill like copywriting so you can start a freelancing business, set a meaningful finish line for yourself.
            
            <p>If the course is geared to help you earn a direct financial return such as launch online products, try to estimate what you'll realistically earn from implementing the program over the next few years. That way you'll know how long it will probably take to recoup your investment.
            
            <p>If for example you’re interested in spending $2,500 or more for Jeff Walker’s Product Launch Formula, but are new to online marketing, perhaps purchasing his book called <a href="http://jeffwalker.com/books/" target="_blank"> Launch</a>, would be a smarter investment to begin with.
            
            <p>If you do not yet know exactly how you would put what you’re learning to good use, then that’s a sign perhaps the timing for that particular program is not right for you.
            
            <h3>2.  Would it kill you to wait six months or a year to buy the program?</h3>
            No matter how often someone online tells you the program is going to close for good or be a lot more expensive the next time it opens, there always will be a next time either with that program, or a competitor’s.
            
            Normally the price when a course reopens is not significantly higher — 10% to 30% is typically what I’ve witnessed. (On a side note, online courses often start off at their least expensive initially and become more expensive as the content improves over time, unlike most traditional products.) Avoid buying something simply because the deadline is approaching. Fear of missing out — also called scarcity — is an emotional trigger used in sales to try to get you to buy. Don’t fall for it.
            
            <p>The one caveat to this is if you feel certain you will eventually put the content to good use, and if you buy now you will gain lifetime access (which is standard for most courses). I purchased a course called Teaching Sells for $2,000 because I really wanted the knowledge of the course, and figured I’d eventually put it to good use. Although I did not use it immediately, it was always in the back of my mind and I have returned to it more than once. If you’re in a similar situation, sometimes it makes sense to buy when you first have the chance. Also, some programs promise to give you all the updated content for free, while others ask for more money for the newer versions of the course. That may influence when you should buy as well.
            
            <h3>3.  Have you checked to see if the same information is accessible to you elsewhere for a less expensive price point, or even free?</h3>
            
            <p>As much as that online class seems like the only one of its kind in history, there’s a good chance the information isn’t all that new. It typically is new in the sense that it sits at the intersection of a couple different disciplines. Teaching Sells, for example, mixes copywriting techniques with instructional design to teach a unique course on how to sell online through the Web.
            
            <p>But the information itself in the $2,000 course is available in copywriting books and instructional design books written especially in the last 75 years. Some of it even dates back to philosophers such as Aristotle. So before you buy, consider that the core of what you would learn may be at your local library or available through a book. It may not come packaged nicely, but you could learn the information without the price tag. Just make sure if you purchase the course, you decide the price is worth the added expense over checking out a text book from the library. Once reason online courses are growing in popularity, is linked to people realizing you can make a lot more money by selling a course online versus providing the exact same information as a book. It's simply valued more by people in an online class format.
            
            <h3>4.  Have you learned a lot from (and implemented) the information you received prior to purchasing?</h3>
            While some courses are available to sign up for at any time, others periodically open for new members. Part of how the programs sell you to purchase, is through enticing you to scarf up a plethora of high-quality, free content. In some cases the content is so good that people have attained the result the course sells just through using the free content and never actually purchasing the course!
            
            <p>Sometimes there’s just as much if not more juicy content in the freebies than in the actual course itself. So if you’re on the fence, see if there’s enough information to attempt implementing the core lessons you get for free. Often a course will give you the “What” and the “Why” of what they are teaching, and then sell the “How to implement this yourself" portion. Certain courses give away so much of the how that if you’re short on cash, this is a good way to reap a lot of the rewards without purchasing. The free ebook library <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/" target="_blank"> Copyblogger offers</a> is an example of this.
            <h3>5.  Are you keeping in mind that truly profiting from the course comes only once you’ve implemented what you’ve learned?</h3>
            Do not fool yourself into thinking it’s going to be easy, or fast.
            If you are learning to achieve some sort of outcome — starting your own business, selling a product online, or helping transition to a new niche or career because of courses you are taking online — view this as a project that may take a year or even years to implement. No matter how much the course speeds up your learning curve, this is a long-haul project.
            
            <h3>6.  Can you afford to lose the money?</h3>
            
            <p>Many courses sell the notion of how much money you’ll make because they have shaved months or years off your learning curve. They encourage you to think of it as an “investment.” They aren’t necessarily lying, but it’s up to you to make that revenue happen. Just taking the course without implementation does not count.
            
            <p>Many people who take the courses tend to take years to implement, if they implement it at all. Also, all the "newness" of the program you bought rapidly wears off just like that new toy a few days after Christmas when you start actually doing the work and don’t get to watch cool videos about doing the work. Although it may sound harsh, it's better to go in thinking that you won't recoup the money invested in the course.  If you are looking at a course because you are currently experiencing a financial hardship, strongly consider getting a second job delivering pizzas or waiting tables. That’s more of a sure thing to fix a short-run financial issue.  You can always work on the course on the side.
            
            <h3>7.  Have you checked out third-party reviews for the course you want to take?</h3>
            <p>Don’t rely on the testimonials from the seller. While those may be true and accurate, obviously their biggest fans wrote them. To get a fair assessment of the course visit third-party review sites like this one or <a href="http://www.skilledup.com/" target="_blank">Skilled Up</a>, or even simply search Google for “Reviews for X course.”
            
            <h3>8.  Is study and implementation time for this course on your schedule?</h3>
            <p>Generally what gets scheduled gets done. So if you’re in a period of your life where you are overbooked already and don’t see how you can free up your schedule for a few hours each week to work on your program, then perhaps the timing isn’t right for you.
            
            <p>I recommend getting up an hour early or booking an hour in the evening to go through material. Unlike a course you’re paying for at a local college, you have to make time. Not meeting weekly with others at a set time and place makes it easy to squeeze the work in around your schedule, but also put off when you’re tired or want to watch TV instead.
            
            <p>If this is a struggle for you, I especially recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Early-To-Rise-Experience-ebook/dp/B00B67PHOU" target="_blank">The Early To Rise Experience by Andy Traub</a> which helped me in one month become a person who rises at 5 a.m. most days.
            
            <p>It’s the best and only book I’ve ever read on the value of waking up early, and it’s formatted to help you actually build the habit of rising early. It’s also interesting to note that people who most of us would consider successful tend to get up several hours prior to having to start their normal work days.
            
            <h3>9.  Have you prioritized the classes or modules to get through the most relevant information first?</h3>
            <p>Even though I have a year-long subscription to Lynda.com, I still probably won’t scratch the surface of even 10% of the excellent content I’d like to absorb.
            
            <p>While Lynda.com provides a particularly gargantuan smorgasbord of all-you-can-eat content, many courses take four hours or longer to watch. So particularly if you are considering a subscription-based service, work in advance to chart a course for what content you most want to absorb by a certain date. That way you won’t find yourself 11 months into it with your subscription on the brink of expiration and you’ve hardly touched the courses which were the reason you purchased the subscription in the first place.</p>
            
            <h3>10.  Have you looked around for others selling the same course as an affiliate?</h3>
            <p>Especially during big launches, if you search for “Reviews of" and "Name of course” in Google you’ll find people who are affiliates for the course. That means they are helping the course creator get more people to buy in exchange for a cut of the sales they bring in. You pay the same amount no matter who you buy the course from, but the course creator might split what you pay with these individuals. On large courses there are sometimes hundreds of affiliates. During big product launches, find an affiliate selling the same course you want to buy, because typically you’ll get a bunch of extra ebooks or small courses from that person, in exchange for using their link to purchase the course you were going to buy anyway.</p>
            
            <p>If you have honestly answered all these questions and still want to purchase the course, then congratulations on your new purchase! If you’ve decided to hold off on buying for now, congratulations as well on thinking it through!</p>
